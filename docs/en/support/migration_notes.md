title: Updates & Migration
description: Repository migration, submodule strategy, and compatibility notes.

## What This Page Covers

This page is used to record:

- repository remote changes
- submodule URL updates
- structural doc changes
- compatibility notes between older and newer workspace layouts

## Current Direction

The repository has been moving from personal ownership toward organization-managed repositories. As part of that process:

- the main repository and submodules need consistent remote rules
- `.gitmodules` should stay friendly for cloning
- deployment documentation should stay aligned with the actual repository structure

## Current Rules

- `.gitmodules` uses HTTPS so non-maintainers can clone recursively
- maintainers may keep SSH `pushurl` locally for push access
- profile-based submodule checkout should use the root Makefile, for example `make submodules-uav`
- CI / Docker builds may write `COLCON_IGNORE` temporarily to skip hardware-only or platform-specific packages; that file should not be committed

## Recent Structure Changes
