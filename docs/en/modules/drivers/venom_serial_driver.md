## Module Role

`venom_serial_driver` is the project-specific serial communication layer between the onboard computer and the lower-level control board.

It is typically used for:

- command delivery
- status feedback
- robot-level control bridging

## Why It Matters

This package is often the final bridge between high-level ROS 2 decisions and custom controller-side execution.
